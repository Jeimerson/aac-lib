## ISO Library Tool

### Description
iso-lib.sh is a tool to help maintain a library of blu-ray, DVD, or CD
data disks. I write to Blu-Ray as a removable media backup which I can
store in a safe or offsite. A more permanent storage solution than
spinning rust or even SSDs. The tool has 4 major options:

- --prepare <directory> - prepares the target directory for burning. This will remove Synology and Mac specific additions to directories, as well as list those items that are not compressed in some fashion.
- --compile <directory> - compiles the target directory into a list of missing files from the existing blu-ray discs.
- --create <directory> - creates a DVD/Blu-ray data disc from the target directory based on the results of the --compile option.
- --rebuild - rebuilds the library from existing discs

Normal usage would be to rebuild, prepare, insert a blank disc, compile,
then create. Compile and Create are required for each new disc to
be created.

Other options include:

- --help - to get help
- --device <device> - device to use to burn disc

### Dependencies
To properly burn blu-ray discs on Linux you need to use the
official Joerg Schilling Cdrecord-ProDVD-ProBD-Clone v3 binary from
http://cdrtools.sourceforge.net/private/cdrecord.html

No other version burns blu-ray's properly. You end up with coasters
without Joerg Schilling's version.

### Installation
Place in /usr/local/bin, $HOME/bin, or anywhere within your path. The
tool does use sudo, so sudo access for mounting and unmounting loopback
devices is required.
